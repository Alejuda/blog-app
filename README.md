# Blog App <a name="about-project"></a>

Introducing my first project, the 'Blog App.' I built this using Rails and PostgreSQL. It's a website where people can write and share their stories. You can also show you like a story or talk about it by adding comments. It's a place to connect and enjoy writing!
